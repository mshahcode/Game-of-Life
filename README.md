# Game-of-Life


[Doxy Documentation (Comments)](https://mshahcode.github.io/Game-of-Life/)

## Introduction

The main idea of this project was to create a Game of Life defined by the English mathematician John Conway using the C programming language.   
Two versions of the game were created. The ANSI board was required to display the cells. To draw bigger and beautier boards, the SDL was implemented.  
CUnit Tests were implemented within the project, to test all the functions and make sure that 100% coverage was obtained.
